      <section className="about-text">
        <p>
          I completed my Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in 2022 and
          later transitioned into web development after discovering a passion
          for coding during the COVID-19 pandemic. To build my technical
          expertise, I completed a Full Stack Web Development Course at Pro
          Stack Academy (Feb 2024 – Aug 2024), where I gained proficiency in
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Redux, Redux Toolkit, Node.js,
          Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB, and Python.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my internship at Greet Labs Pvt Ltd (Oct 2024 – Dec 2024), I
          worked on real-world web applications, collaborated with development
          teams, and strengthened my skills in frontend and backend development.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have developed full-stack projects, including ShopCART and
          RapidRetails, where I built responsive UIs using React.js, managed
          state with Redux, developed RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express, and
          handled databases with MongoDB and MySQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a strong foundation in business and technology, I am eager to
          contribute to innovative projects and grow as a MERN Stack Developer.
